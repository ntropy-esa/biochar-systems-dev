## **A continuum of thermochemical conversion...**

The thermochemical conversion of biomass is a continuum of transformation processes during which biomass is heated up to a certain temperature, for a certain time, at a certain speed, under given atmospheric conditions. 

For a given biomass, thermochemical conversion processes distinguish themselves by 3 main parameters:
- Highest Treatment Temperature (HHT, in &deg;C), also known as pyrolysis temperature. It varies between 300&deg;C and 1200&deg;C. 
- Residence Time (RT, in min) at the highest treatment temperature. It can vary from seconds up to several hours or even days.
- Heating Rate (HR, in &deg;C/min). It can vary from few &deg;C/min to several hundred &deg;C/min. 

In addition, the pressure and the composition of the atmosphere in the reactor also distinguish thermochemical processes.

- Slow & intermediate pyrolysis: corresponds to low heating rates, with temperatures in the range of 200 to 900&deg;C. It is the main process used to make biochar. Mass propertions of biochar, liquids, and gases are roughly equal to 1/3 each, with variability introduced by biomass type & process conditions.

- Fast & flash pyrolysis: corresponds to very high heating rates, at high temperature, with very short residence time. It is the main process for making pyrolysis oil, with mass yields up to 75% of the input dry biomass.

- Gasification: corresponds to treatment at very high temperature, up to 1200&deg;C, sometimes in the partial presence of an oxidant like oxygen. Gases are the main products. Biochar mass yields rarely exceed 15% under gasification conditions, which imply that gasification chars have relatively high ash contents.

- Torrefaction: corresponds to a special kind of pyrolysis, in a temperature range between 200 and 300&deg;C. The purpose of torrefaction is to maximise the production of solids, lightly carbonised biomass, and to retain most of the biomass' energy in the solids. Torrefaction is sometimes used to improve the properties of a biomass fuel, e.g. in terms of storage convenience or grindability. However, long-term carbon sequestration is deemed not possible with char from torrefaction.

- Hydrothermal carbonisation: it takes place in an aaqueous environment, at high pressure and temperature. It is suited for the production of hydrochar from wet biomass. The name hydrochar is used to differentiate it from biochar produced from other processes, due to its different chemical composition and structure. Long-term carbon sequestration is not either deemed possile with hydrochar.
