## **Installed pyrolysis plants**

The number of pyrolysis plants (for biochar production) installed in Europe is increasing. In 2020, the European Biochar Institute estimated that there were 72 plants installed, with a total production capacity of 20 000 tonnes of biochar per year (EBI, 2021).

We maintain a survey of installed biochar production capacity. To contribute, please answer <u>[the survey]()</u>.
